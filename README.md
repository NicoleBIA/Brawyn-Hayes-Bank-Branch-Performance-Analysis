# Branwyn-Hayes Bank
Branch Performance Intelligence Report
KPI Trends, Strategic Insights, and Economic Interpretation

This project presents a Power BI branch performance report built for a fictional retail bank, Branwyn-Hayes Bank. Using simulated multi-year data, it explores operational KPIs, product usage, digital and in-branch channel trends, loan penetration, and customer behavior patterns.

Designed as both a performance overview and strategic analysis tool, the report highlights how macroeconomic shifts—such as inflation and digital banking adoption—may impact customer engagement, lending behavior, and revenue distribution at the branch level.

## Business Purpose & Core Questions

This report was built to simulate how a regional retail bank might evaluate the performance of its physical branches in today’s evolving financial landscape.
Using Power BI and simulated datasets, the analysis answers key strategic and operational questions:

- How are customer engagement patterns shifting between digital and in-branch channels?
- Which customer segments are driving the most value and loan penetration?
- Are operational costs aligned with revenue performance at the branch level?
- How do macroeconomic forces (e.g., inflation, cost of borrowing) manifest in customer behavior and product usage over time?

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI data modeling, KPI visualizations, DAX measures, and storytelling
- Simulated SQL-structured dataset – includes fact and dimension tables
- DAX for custom measures, % change tracking, and segmentation logic
- Excel for initial data inspection, cleaning and data validation

## Dataset Overview

- The simulated dataset models a fictional bank with:
- 50 retail branches
- 8 customer segments
- 25 core products/services
- 5 years of data (2020–2025)

# The data model is structured in star schema format:

- Fact_BranchPerformance
- Dim_Branch_Region
- Dim_Customer_Segment
- Dim_Product_Service
