# Loan Penetration Peaks Defy Pandemic Expectations, Declines Track Inflationary Pressure

## Business Question: How Did Loan Penetration Behave Across the Pandemic and Inflation Era — and What Can It Reveal About Lending Strategy?
Loan Penetration %, defined as the ratio of customers with active loans relative to the broader customer base, serves as a meaningful barometer of 
lending engagement. For strategic analysts monitoring branch performance or evaluating product demand, this metric helps uncover shifts in customer borrowing behavior 
— and by extension, risk appetite, credit access, and macroeconomic influence.

## Trend Overview:
Between 2020 and 2025, Loan Penetration % peaked in 2021 (13.2%) and 2022 (13.0%), outpacing the overall 5-year average of 12.7%

## Challenge to Assumption:
Contrary to expectations that COVID-19 would suppress borrowing activity in 2020 and beyond, the data reveals stronger-than-average lending engagement during the immediate post-pandemic years.
