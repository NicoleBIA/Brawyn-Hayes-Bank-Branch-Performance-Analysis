## **Branch Performance Insights Report**  
KPI Trends, Strategic Insights, and Economic Interpretation

This project presents a Power BI branch performance report built for a fictional retail bank, Branwyn-Hayes Bank. Using simulated multi-year data, it explores operational KPIs, product usage, digital and in-branch channel trends, loan penetration, and customer behavior patterns.

Designed as both a performance overview and strategic analysis tool, the report highlights how macroeconomic shifts such as inflation and digital banking adoption; may impact customer engagement, lending behavior, and revenue distribution at the branch level.

## Business Purpose & Core Questions

This report was built to simulate how a regional retail bank might evaluate the performance of its physical branches in today’s evolving financial landscape.
Using Power BI and simulated datasets, the analysis answers key strategic and operational questions:

- How are customer engagement patterns shifting between digital and in-branch channels?
- Which customer segments are driving the most value and loan penetration?
- Are operational costs aligned with revenue performance at the branch level?
- How do macroeconomic forces (e.g., inflation, cost of borrowing) manifest in customer behavior and product usage over time?

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI data modeling, KPI visualizations, DAX measures, and storytelling
- Simulated SQL-structured dataset – includes fact and dimension tables
- DAX for custom measures, % change tracking, and segmentation logic
- Excel for initial data inspection, cleaning and data validation

## Dataset Overview

- The simulated dataset models a fictional bank with:
- 50 retail branches
- 8 customer segments
- 25 core products/services
- 5 years of data (2020–7/2025)

# The data model is structured in star schema format:

- Fact_BranchPerformance
- Dim_Branch_Region
- Dim_Customer_Segment
- Dim_Product_Service

## Key KPIs Tracked

- Total Customers (Record-Based)
- Loan Penetration %
- Digital Usage %
- In-Branch Usage %
- Average Loan Amount
- Total Deposits
- Estimated Fee & Interest Revenue
- Operational Costs
- Average Balance per Customer
- Branch Satisfaction Score
- Revenue per Customer

## Insights & Strategic Interpretation

The project goes beyond simple KPI tracking by surfacing insights related to:
- Loan Penetration Decline Post-2022 – signaling rising cost of borrowing and inflation fatigue
- In-Branch vs. Digital Usage Patterns – suggesting operational recalibration opportunities
- Customer Segment Differentiation – highlighting high-value vs. high-risk segmen
- Operational Costs vs. Performance – identifying branches with high cost-to-revenue ratios

## Project Intent

This project was developed to demonstrate how business intelligence tools can support branch-level strategy in a dynamic financial environment.
It highlights the ability to use data-backed insights to inform decisions around customer engagement, operational priorities, and loan product trends.

By blending operational analytics, consumer behavior interpretation, and economic context framing, the report models how a Strategy Support Analyst might synthesize complex data into clear, actionable intelligence.

The insights reflect both the everyday realities of managing a retail branch network and the broader economic forces shaping customer decisions—positioning the work at the intersection of strategy, operations, and behavioral economics.

## Stakeholders

This report is designed to support a range of decision-makers and collaborators across the retail banking and strategy landscape, including:
- Strategic Analysts and Branch Planning Teams looking to understand performance trends at the regional and branch level.
- Operations Managers interested in optimizing customer engagement and resource allocation across digital and in-branch channels.
- Product and Loan Teams seeking insight into adoption patterns and cross-sell performance.
- Data Analysts and BI Developers aiming to translate business questions into interactive Power BI reports.
- Cross-functional partners, including recruiters, hiring managers, and technical collaborators, evaluating business intelligence capabilities and strategic thinking.
